Hey! If you are reading this you probably know me somehow. I recently moved to Washington to start my job in the environmental world. Recently I have been wanting to have a space where I can talk about things that I enjoy. When you aren't surrounded by friends (like in college) you find that you actually don't have many places to discuss your thoughts on just about anything. So - I created this website using free online resources, so I didn't have to buy a domain or anything which is cool

(Leaving this here so I remember how to hyperlink and bold things - but this is also the creator of the theme and architecure I'm using if you are interested)
While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which works really well with GitHub Pages. I figured it would do just fine for my friend and I set about searching for a pretty theme. I wanted a theme with a _book-ish_ vibe. Unfortunately, most of the themes were too modern. Eventually, I caved and begun working on my own theme. With the help of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll Butler, I was able to build **Tale**.

## Appreesh you for reading
