As much as it is a surprise to you, it is a surprise to me that my first post on this blog will be a music review of Addison Rae's first album, Addison. 

***Huge Disclaimer: I know nothing about music, I've never studied it, this is just my opinion.***

I first realized that this album was real when I heard the song "Headphones On" while I was on the way to a golf round. Now, my first impression of this song (and therefore album) was that the line "Wish my mom and dad could've been in love" as the first line of the first verse was insane, lmao. It's actually so jarring to hear for the first time. However, I think that this oddity of a line does represent a theme that exists throughout this album. That theme is, "out of place". When listening to this album I often found myself asking "why is this song placed after that last song?" or "Who picked the track order?" or "Who produced this song and why does it sound so sonically different than the others?" Listening to this album all the way through in one go is a little confusing.

These critiques don't come without any positives however. In order for there to be low moments, there must be high moments. I think the best thing this album does is channel the same energy as the remix of Von Dutch featuring Addison Rae. I think that version of Von Dutch is universally agreed to be a banger. Listening to it now. Anyway, songs like New York and Fame is a Gun capture this energy and are certainly the highlights on this project. Other songs seem to have an electronic or R&B influence, but in my opinion, don't neccesarily mix well with the vocals or production.

It is also important to note that this album is only 33 minutes long with 12 tracks. This album can be listened to on your commute! This follows a trend we are seeing in the music industry for sure, but also kind of feels like a sellout. There's two interludes as well. It's just not that much music. Lastly, before I discuss specific tracks, I have to say that I do like the album cover. It's got hints of early 2000's with the font choice and the color editing, and I do enjoy it.

Final score at the bottom!

**New York**

In the opening song we get a slow opening transitioning into an electro-pop banger. The vocals sound good, and the production and manipulation of her voice to create an interesting sound that is nice on the ears. The narrative of the song isn't anything special. It's basically just her saying she loves New York. It is interesting that her calling herself a "dance whore" doesn't get this song marked as explicit though, lol. The end is my favorite. You might ask "Isn't the end of this song just her singing "Na-na-na-na" over and over again?" Well...yea...but it sounds fire.

**Diet Pepsi**

While this song isn't a new release, it's still here! Do I think that New York transitions into this song very well? No, no I don't. Do I still think this song is good? For sure. The beat on this song is really simple, and it allows for her voice to be the star of the show. The chorus is really nice, and the song pulls on the heart strings. Who doesn't like to think about being in love and having sex in the car? I mean there is a reason this song has over 500 million streams. 
I do think it's kind of strange that this song has two outros? They change the sound of the chorus twice before the song ends. Particularly the second outro is like slowed and reverbed? For some reason? Anyway, I enjoy this song.

**Money is Everything**

The start of this song has Addison talking about how her Mom told her to save her money so she didn't have to depend on a man. Which is cool. Then we get some descending synths going in the background AND THENNNNNNN we get Addison Rae singing "Pocket full of sunshine, busting through the seam."
In my opinion, this song just doesn't sound great? Particularly the pocket full of sunshine line. The beat behind this song is kind of loud and noisy. In the first verse she talks about various woman symbols in music like Madonna, Lady Gaga, and Lana Del Ray, which is cool, but I don't love her vocal performance. This one verse is also the only verse, other than that it's just a chorus over and over again.
This is the first example of a song just feeling out of place. She even said in an interview "It's a complete 360 from Diet Pepsi." Correct! It's produced so differently, it sounds so different. Maybe I'm just an album purist who likes albums to be a collective piece of art and not just songs thrown together, idk!
I'd say I'm a feminist - but I don't love this song.

**Aquamarine**

I think this is my least favorite song on this album. The beat is like I'm underwater in Atlantis, but I'm at a shitty club in Atlantis. When the beat drops and she sings "The world is my oyster, baby, come touch the pearl" I physically cringe. Not only is the line extremely on the nose, but the beat is *so* bad. Her vocal performance actually improves throughout the song, and by the end I think this song recovers a bit. 

I just have to say the lines in this song mean nothing to me, lol. For example:
"Aquamarine" Yeah I like the color...
"Honey, dive into me" Okay I know what this line means
"I'm not hiding anymore" What
"I won't hide" okay got it
"I'm free" What are you free from
What are you talking about? Does anyone know?

Jokes aside I just don't like this song.

**Lost & Found**

This is an interlude, it's only 46 seconds. It's just some spacey synths. I guess it kind of leads into High Fashion cause she says "Drug, drug" for most of it.

Thank you Addison, very cool.

**High Fashion**

I'm having a hard time describing this song. It's kind of like they took a Chainsmokers type beat an then had Addison sing the same chorus over and over on it for 3 minutes. There's two verses but they both are less than 15 seconds. The outro is her singing "I'd rather get" for 20 seconds. 

Oh and remember how in the interlude before this she kept singing "Drug, drug"? Well in this song she says she doesn't need your drugs and just wants high fashion. I don't actually have an issue with the continuity between the interlude and this song, but, the content of this song is genuinely so boring.

This is another example of a song that just feels super out of place. She even said in an interview about this song that it confused people the most. She said she liked the title "High Fashion" but the song kept not working and they brought in another songwriter to help make it work.

I think we could have left this one out.

**Summer Forever**

This is the first song in the album that steps away from the electro-pop vibe and it's great! It's kind of a modern love ballad and Addison sings it great. Like Diet Pepsi, the beat is pretty minamlist with some drums and other noises, but her voice does a great job filling the space.

The pre-chorus in this song is actually awesome. It flows so well, she sings it so well, the background ad-libs add a lot to the atmosphere. The chorus is also great. She is basically talking about loving during summer, and it's really well done. Listening to this song I feel like I'm watching a short film with two people falling in love with sunsets in the background. 

**In The Rain**

This song is a pretty good follow up to Summer Forever in terms of tracking. This song is a lowkey pop song, with Addison touching on themes like putting on a smile for the show and crying in the rain. I really enjoy the vocal performance on this song. Other than, not much to say. The beat is decent. The outro is a little long for my taste though (especially cause she sings the same line for over a minute).

**Fame is a Gun**

This is 100% the best song on this album. Remember the Von Dutch vibe I mentioned earlier? This song is that. I've been listening to this song multiple times a day since I first heard it. 

The intro is great, a little bit of whispering/singing teasing a really nice rhythmic beat with a great hi-hat. And then just like that she sings "Fame is a gun" and then the song is off to the races. Her voice sounds great, the little star noise (I don't know how else to describe it) is awesome. The second verse dips back into the whispering/singing, and then the chorus is a banger again. 

No notes, this song is great, makes me feel like I'm a pop-star doing molly at the club (I've never done molly, this is just what I imagine it's like).

**Times Like These**

You would think after a banger like that she might follow it up with something else upbeat. Unfortunately... she comes back with what I would describe as a bedroom pop song? This song is essentially Addison talking about how her life moves really fast now and how "In times like these, this is how it has to be" Whatever that means!

Couple notes on the lyrics:
"Am I too young to be this mad?" No...
"Head out the window, let's see how far I'll go" Golden retriever POV

This song she also said in an interview is like High Fashion how it's out of place, yep... Anyway! The beat on this song is boring, the singing is fine, next song.

**Life's No Fun Through Clear Waters**

This is a minute long interlude to the next song. We've got some nice strings going on in the background, feels like I'm at the symphony, it's cool.

Just gotta note that the previous song doesn't lead into this, and this definitely does *not* lead into the next song. Could do without it.

**Headphones On**

After the nice symphony, it's time for pop! I like this song - I think that the vocal sample in the background adds some nice depth. The drum kick is cool. It's definitely got some R&B influence as well. It's mostly about acceptance in life, through it's ups and downs. BIG song for those who believe in karma as she repeatedly says "every good thing comes my way"

**Final Score**

Lowkey I feel like I just wrote a lot about an album I probably won't listen to again for a while. Anyway...Like I said in the opening, this album takes you on roller coaster that is just everywhere. Sometimes its electro-pop, sometimes its a love ballad, sometimes its Aquamarine and you are so confused how you got there. Also I touched on this in the song reviews, but I just wish that there was more cohesion in theme. There's no story here, it's just a collection of songs. I always find that my favorite albums produce a story.

Final score: 4/7

*my scoring is gonna be out of 7 because I feel like it*
