As I've passed my fifth month living in Bellevue, Washington, if you've asked how I like living here, I would probably give you a simple answer "I don't really like it."

When I moved into this apartment it was out of urgency really. I arrived in Bellevue for my job on a Thursday, with my job starting next Monday. I shopped around and toured six apartment complexes. Only one tour I went on was in-person and guided. This tour that I went on in person was where I ended up living. It is on the outskirts of the Downtown Bellevue area, so it is slightly more expensive than the other options. This was a decision I justified to myself however. I said, "If I'm gonna live near a big city, I might as well fully experience it." 

Now I wouldn't say this has been a bad decision. There are times where I appreciate the convenience of living in a "big city." I oftentimes walk to the bus station in order to grab a bus ride to the airport. I sometimes walk outside and go grab a coffee. I generally enjoy walkable city and it feels like I get a taste of that.

Besides these few conveniences, I actually dislike Bellevue, and I believe that the architecture of the downtown area has created the culture of the city, one I'm not particularly fond of. I will continually edit the below section where I will try to describe why I feel the way I do about Downtown Bellevue. I plan on this post being an ongoing effort, therefore I will leave a date stating when I last worked on it.

Bellevue is a city built vertically like Seattle, but has the car infrastructure of Houston. 

As you drive into Downtown Bellevue, it truly gives off the essense of a big city. There's a stretch of 405 specifically that I drive almost every day, and when I come back home at night, I oftentimes enjoy this view a lot. There are a ton of skyscrapers, with unique designs, and there is a lot hills. This creates a staggering effect which creates a nice skyline.
