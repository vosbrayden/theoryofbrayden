Recently I feel as though I have reflected on my life more than usual. From moving to Seattle, a place where I know almost no one, to living alone, and working a job for longer than a summer, a lot of things have been in transition. Throughout all of this, there has been one thing that has become abundantly clear to me...

**I think our parents might have been right about everything**

This is an exaggerated position, obviously there are still things that me and my parents may disagree on. But as a whole - it's really been making sense recently.

I've shared with a few people recently that as I've gotten older, I've realized that my parents are just two kids who grew up. I'm 22 as I write this. My parents had me at 29 and 30, they had my sister at 26 and 27. That's not ***that*** far away. Plus, there is a lot of parents out there that have kids at a lot younger than 29 and 30. 

I say all this to make the point that as you get older, you realize that your parents were just trying their best. And I don't mean trying their best in the way that we say "I'll try my best!" at a sports game. This is a try that spans years, and years. This is a try that is grueling and long. This is a try that is commits you to a lifetime of support. 

Here's a couple of things that have popped into my brain that I disagreed with my parents about that now makes **so** much sense.

***Have to add that some of these are from when I was like 8, so don't think these were all recent***

-"Why would we ever go to the gate at the airport before we get food?" Because you have to make sure that you can reach the gate in a timely manner for boarding. Some airport gates are farther away than you think.
-"Why would we clean the house before we leave for a vacation?" Because you want to return to a clean house. 
-"Why is it neccesary to get the day started before 11 AM on a weekend?" Because it feels good to utilize your free time in a way that makes you happy or feel accomplished.
-"Who likes leftovers?" You do. You do because then you don't have to cook the next day. Obviously.
-"Why would you go to bed before midnight?" Because you have a natural sleep cycle. Follow it. You'll probably feel better.
-"Why do I have to brush my teeth before I go to sleep? I wanna go to sleep now" My mom used to tell me that you only get one set of teeth in life, so you have to take care of them. I definitely agree and understand now...something something prefrontal cortex development.

These are obviously not serious situations or serious arguements. But the idea that your parents are constantly trying to teach you something is so powerful when you look back at your childhood.

I've been someone who tries to have a sense of humor about everything for as long as I can remember. I think finding the comedy in any situation always brings relief to all parties involved. I mean, we're just on a floating rock til we die, how can anything be that important? This humor however, has existed for better or for worse. When I analyze my interactions with my parents from times past I oftentimes realize that my willingness to make a joke and move on, rather than perhaps learn a lesson from a situation might have held back my character development. This isn't something I regret, I mean what am I gonna do? Change who I was as a child? But I just think it's interesting.

Being a parent and teaching your kids important life lessons sounds really hard. As I grow up I continually grow more and more respect for what my parents did for me. Additionally, as I move forward in my life I think it's important to always be open to those trying to give you wisdom. You don't have to accept all the wisdom, but if it's given to you, consider it.

Anyway, if you take anything from this, just realize: Your parents are just kids that grew up, and maybe they make good points every once in a while.
